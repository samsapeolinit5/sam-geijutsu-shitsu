      こんにちは、みんな (kon’nichiwa, min’n) , myself SAM aka Samik Sardar. Currently rocking my 2nd year 
      in B-Tech, majoring Computer Science and Engineering. I love creating things that inspire and help 
      people, whether it is a short film showcasing different perspectives through my cinematography skills 
      or a coding project that makes all of our lives easier. I believe that every challenge is an opportunity 
      to grow and every idea hold the potential to change the world. My journey is driven by a relentless 
      curiosity and a passion for innovation. As a student of Technology and an Artist at heart, I strive to 
      blend creativity with logic, crafting solutions that are not only functional but also impactful.
